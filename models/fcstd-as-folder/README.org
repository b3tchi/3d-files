* Notes for exporting freecad fcstd to folder
testing options to migrate to main freecad from linkstage3

* in [[freecad]] to export binary file as folder
** there are binary files all are linked in =GuiDocument.xml= from tags =<MaterialList>= =<ColorList>=
#+BEGIN_SRC
search:
<(ColorList|MaterialList) file="?(.*)"/>
replace:
<$1 file=""/>
#+END_SRC
** there are some other files but they are text [[https://wiki.freecad.org/File_Format_FCStd][manual]]
** using zip command bring errors but there is utility inside freecad to un/pack files under =Tools= > =Document utility...= it has extract and build options [[https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_ProjectUtil][manual]]
*** in freecad repository there is responsible [[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/47c1565edfce18f3aeb87e8d8f436dda473d174f/src/Ext/freecad/project_utility.py][project_utility.py]]
*** it's installed under python site packages and could referenced from [[python]]
